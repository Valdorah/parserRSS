This is a project which I have created during my DUT.  
The project's aim is learn PHP language by creating a news reading site.  

## Usage
You must be use a server to launch this website. I use [Wamp](http://www.wampserver.com/en/ "link to Wamp").  
But you can use an other software if you want.

You can find in the config/config.php file these information :
- Server name
- Login
- Password  

This informations are use by default with Wamp on Windows and are important to set up a connection with the server. If you use an other sofware, you may need to change them.

You can find in database directory a file to import in your server.
